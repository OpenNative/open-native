# Searching for native modules
The best place to look for react native native modules is on Github. There are some directories such as [react native directory](https://reactnative.directory/?search=push+notification) however I have always found the incomplete and missing many modules/ out there. So it's best to do a simple search for the module on Github.

For example, let's say you want to implement auth in your app and you need a native module for it. You can go to Github and search `react native auth`. Prefixing your search with `react native` will  most often show up a module if it exists.

Great! we found the official `auth0` native module `react-native-auth0`! Similarly you can search any module/library out there made for react native and use it in your NativeScript app with Open Native.
