Open Native is the long overdue Rosetta Stone that **allows native modules to be used cross-ecosystem**. It handles all the necessary autolinking, type marshalling and API-binding to allow you to choose the highest quality native module for your project, no matter what ecosystem it comes from.

For our first integration, we've **enabled NativeScript to use React Native native modules** exactly as documented for React Native.

Open Native **implements just the native module API and autolinking** for a given ecosystem (e.g. React Native) without including any unnecessary core code or CLI tooling. It then exposes the native APIs in an ecosystem-agnostic manner that another framework (e.g. NativeScript) can provide a minimal adapter for.

For our first integration, we've **enabled NativeScript to use React Native native modules** the same way one would use them in React Native.

## Thanks to

- **[Osei Fortune](https://github.com/triniwiz)**: For his expert help with the NativeScript Android runtime.
- **[Eduardo Speroni](https://github.com/edusperoni/)**: For his expert help with v8 as we take on JSI.
- **[The NativeScript Community](https://discord.com/invite/RgmpGky9GR)**: For being awesome day after day. It's hard to name everyone who helped us and encouraged us to accomplish this.
- **[React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)**: We both have a background in React Native and were able to learn a lot from it. This wouldn't have been possible without React Native and the communities around it.
