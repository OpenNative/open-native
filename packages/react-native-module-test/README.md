# @ammarahm-ed/react-native-module-test

Some simple React Native native modules arranged in a format compatible with NativeScript plugins for easy installation, allowing comparison between the two and helping us develop towards full conformance.

This package purely contains native code (see the `platforms` folder) and the `index.ts` file is merely a placeholder in case we find a use for some JS code in future. The idea is that our React Native and NativeScript demo apps will install this as a native module (React Native) or plugin (NativeScript).

For the best experience editing this source code, you'd open either the React Native or NativeScript demo app (which will have these modules ready-linked) and develop them from there.
