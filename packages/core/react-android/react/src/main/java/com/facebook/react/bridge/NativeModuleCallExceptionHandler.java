/**
 * Interface for a class that knows how to handle an Exception thrown by a native module invoked
 * from JS. Since these Exceptions are triggered by JS calls (and can be fixed in JS), a common way
 * to handle one is to show a error dialog and allow the developer to change and reload JS.
 *
 * <p>We should also note that we have a unique stance on what 'caused' means: even if there's a bug
 * in the framework/native code, it was triggered by JS and theoretically since we were able to set
 * up the bridge, JS could change its logic, reload, and not trigger that crash.
