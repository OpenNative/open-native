/**
 * Main interface for providing additional capabilities to the catalyst framework by couple of
 * different means:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Registering new native modules
 *   <li>Registering new JS modules that may be accessed from native modules or from other parts of
 *       the native code (requiring JS modules from the package doesn't mean it will automatically
 *       be included as a part of the JS bundle, so there should be a corresponding piece of code on
 *       JS side that will require implementation of that JS module so that it gets bundled)
 *   <li>Registering custom native views (view managers) and custom event types
 *   <li>Registering natively packaged assets/resources (e.g. images) exposed to JS
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>TODO(6788500, 6788507): Implement support for adding custom views, events and resources
